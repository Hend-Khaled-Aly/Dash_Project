# Emotion Prediction Dashboard

This project explores the relationship between social media usage patterns and users’ emotional well-being. Using a dataset capturing various social media activity metrics and dominant emotions, the project performs data analysis, builds predictive models, and provides an interactive dashboard for visualization and real-time emotion prediction.

---

## Dataset

- `dataset.csv` – Training dataset containing social media usage features and corresponding dominant emotions.
- `test.csv` – Test dataset for model evaluation.
- `val.csv` – Validation dataset for tuning model performance.

---

## Files

- `nn_predictions.csv` – Predictions on the test set generated by the Neural Network model.
- `rf_predictions.csv` – Predictions on the test set generated by the Random Forest model.
- `xgb_predictions.csv` – Predictions on the test set generated by the XGBoost model.
- `rf_pipeline.pkl` – Serialized Random Forest pipeline for loading and reuse.
- `dashboard_video.mp4` – Demonstration video showcasing the interactive Dash dashboard.

## Features

- Analyze social media usage metrics such as daily usage time, posts, likes, comments, and messages.
- Predict users’ dominant emotional states based on their social media behavior.
- Interactive Dash dashboard with two pages:
  - **Insights Page:** Visualizes data trends and allows filtering by age groups.
  - **Prediction Page:** Takes user input and predicts the dominant emotion in real-time.
